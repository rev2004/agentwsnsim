This simulator aims to help industry practitioners and researchers in exploring agents in WSNs. A simulation environment for wireless sensor networks that consist of deliberative agents is provided, along with a hardware model (of the TMote Sky), a generic topology, and simple power consumption and wave propagation metrics.

WSN programs are created using multi-agent systems design, and are encoded with the JASON/Agentspeak framework (jason.sourceforge.net). The JASON framework provides each WSN agent with BDI (belief, desire, intention) reasoning capabilities, and a logic programming language "Agentspeak". Multi-agent systems are among the best ways to handle the complexity found in WSN deployment exercises, since they provide a means for distributed problem solving, and make use of autonomic designs.
